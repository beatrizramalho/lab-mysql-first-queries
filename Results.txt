7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.
The apps most rated are the apps the most people uses since it is social apps (an everyone is using social media).
And the big part of the 10 most rated are games which also part of the daily rotine of the people.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
The majority of apps best rated by users, the majority are games, as a lot of people have at least one game on
the phone just to spend a little bit of time it is always appearing a pop-up "Are you enjoying this game?" and
people raking just not to have that annoying pop-up appearing. As compare to social media, there is not that habit to ask for evaluation.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
In both questios, there is games in the top however as expalin in the previous question the social media apps do not have the habit 
to ask for evaluation like game apps have that habit. That's why people only rank social apps in case of issues.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?
Head Soccer
Plants vs. Zombies
Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game

The 3 apps with 5 as the raking and the most number of votes
